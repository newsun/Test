			<p>Exploratory testing is unscripted, unrehearsed testing. Its
				effectiveness depends on several intangibles: the skill of the
				tester, their intuition, their experience, and their ability to
				follow hunches. But it's these intangibles that often confound test
				managers when it comes to being accountable for the results. For
				example, at the end of the day, when the manager asks for status
				from an exploratory tester, they may get an answer like "Oh,
				y'know... I tested some functions here and there, just looking
				around." And even though the tester may have filed several bugs, the
				manager may have no idea what they did to find them. Even if the
				manager was skilled to ask the right questions about what the tester
				did, the tester may have forgotten the details or may not be able to
				describe their thinking out loud, on-the-fly.</p>
			<p>We had this problem when doing exploratory testing for a
				client. We wanted to be accountable for our work. We wanted to give
				status reports that reflected what we actually did. We wanted to
				show that we could be creative, skilled explorers, yet produce a
				detailed map of our travels.</p>
			<h3>How it's done</h3>
			<p>We invented Session-Based Test Management as a way to make
				those intangibles more tangible. It can be thought of as structured
				exploratory testing, which may seem like a contradiction-in-terms,
				but "structure" does not mean the testing is pre-scripted. It means
				we have a set of expectations for what kind of work will be done and
				how it will be reported. As in a recording studio, this work is done
				in "sessions." Sessions range from 45 minutes to several hours, but
				no matter the length, it is time spent testing against a charter for
				the session. The nuts-and-bolts of sessions are described in further
				detail in an article Jonathan Bach wrote for STQE magazine.</p>
			<p>At the end of a session, the tester hands in a session report,
				tagged with important information about what they did. Here is a
				sample.</p>
